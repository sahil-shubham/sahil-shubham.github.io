title = "Day-6, Writing what you don't know"

I am always interested in knowing what things I don't know about, everything isn'ts supposed to learnt immediately, if ever. But knowing what you don't know if one of the most important things in making someone humble.

## How?

Because of this being the first time I was writing this, I just didn't know where to start and how in depth should I go into something before marking it as someting I am good at or not.

I spent ample amount of time thinking about things but was only on my way on getting into an [analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis), so I ended up looking at [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) as a checklist. I am assuming that it's a good enough list for now just based on how many stars it has on GitHub (~168k).

I wouldn't say that I don't know few the things I have kept unmarked but I am doing so that I end up looking into those things once again. It has been a considerable time I looked at them and hence think that I would explore them in more depth if done now.

The three questions that need to be answered are:

- Things I am good at
- Things I want to get better at
- What is my training plan for this?

I am combining question 1 and 2 for now, but would try to answer them separately and be more to the point the next time I make a list like this. I have set a calendar event for 5th September to look back at this.

# Things I am good at & Things I want to get better at
