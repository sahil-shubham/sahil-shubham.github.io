title = "Day-6, Writing a list of what you don't know"
date = 2021-08-05
+++

I am always interested in knowing what things I don't know about, everything isn't supposed to learnt immediately, if ever. But knowing what you don't know is something I find important.

## How?

I never sat down and made a list and used to keep everything in mind. I think it's better that I realize that I also don't know how to remember things :p

Hence, because of this being the first time I was making a list, I just didn't know where to start and how in depth I should go into something before marking it as something I am good at.

I spent ample amount of time thinking but was only on my way on getting into an [analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis), so I ended up looking at [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) as a checklist. I am assuming that it's a good enough list just based on how many stars it has on GitHub (~168k).

Also, I wouldn't say that I don't know few of the things I have kept unmarked, but have kept them unmarked so that I end up looking into those once again. It has been long time since I used/learned them and hence think that I would explore them in more depth if done now.

The three questions that need to be answered here are:

1. Things I am good at
2. Things I want to get better at
3. What is my training plan for this?

I am combining question 1 and 2 for now, but would try to answer them separately next time. I have set a calendar event for 5th September to look back at this.

# Things I am good at & Things I want to get better at
