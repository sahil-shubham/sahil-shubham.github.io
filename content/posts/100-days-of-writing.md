# Why?

"Why?" is the easy part here, I always plan on writing but don't. I made this blog on 25th Feb, 2021 and all there has been is 1 post.
This is unacceptable, I can't keep reading what other people write without putting down my own thoughts somewhere.

Reading is never supposed to be one way thing, even if you [read a book you should think of it as a two-way communication](https://fs.blog/2015/01/marginalia/) between the author and you.

There is always [some work that's required to form opinions](https://fs.blog/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/), doing that work takes a significant effort. Something that not a lot of people do now. Anyone can read and repeat someone's opinion and seem like they know something about something.

## Why 100 days?

100DaysOf\_\_\_\_ anything is just a personal challenge that you set for youself to do any action or allot time to something for everyday, for 100 days straight. Their [website](https://thegreatdiscontent.com/100days) does a better job at explaining:

> It’s a celebration of process that encourages everyone to participate in 100 days of making. The great surrender is the process; showing up day after day is the goal. For the 100-Day Project, it’s not about fetishizing finished products—it’s about the process.

It's not something completly new for me as I did something similar to explore programming (#100DaysOfCode). It was beneficial in a way as rather than asking "why do coding today?" it became "what to code today?".

# Why a Blog and not a Diary?

According to Oxford dicionary, a blog is

> a regularly updated website or web page, typically one run by an individual or small group, that is written in an informal or conversational style.

Blogs have always been a learning place for me, there are a lot of technical blogs out there which make you feel as if you are solving a problem
together with the writer. There are blogs which you stumble upon which may have never been read, but turn out to be the best thing you have read
in a long time.

Not only technical blogs, after finishing a book or a movie there's this strong urge of talking to someone about it or knowing what other people
think about it, any kind of writing is beneficial at this point.

Thoughts whether right or wrong should be penned down, that too openly, because only then you remember the point you had about something
and also discuss the same with other people. [Discussions/notes should be public](https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-07-01-useful-discussions-open/) that is how people learn and interact, putting the effort to make them organized and readable enough to be public, is beneficial for both the writer and the reader.

Over time not much of what I am think now would be left. I won't remember any small details of an achievement, I won't remember any setbacks and much of what I learned from them. All of these would turn into small blips of emotions over a large span of time.
I feel as if even if I don't know much there's always something I can write about which is enough for someone to fix something or start learning something.

# So what now?

It's almost 4 am now, the time I take decisions I regret the most about. But it is what it is. Can't go back now. (Well, technically I can but you get the point)
