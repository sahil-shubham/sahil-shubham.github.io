# Hi there

I'm Sahil, third year undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur. I'm an Open Source enthusiast, and it is one of the reasons for my immense love
for programming. I mostly spend my time writing half broken code in JavaScript, sometimes Python. 

Currently working with Redux and Styled-Components. Also, thinking of converting some old projects in React JavaScript to TypeScript, because why not :) 

Be sure to come back next time, I may have something new to read for you.
