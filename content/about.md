# Hi there

I'm Sahil, second year undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur. I'm a big open source enthusiast, and it is one of the reasons for my immense love
for programming. I mostly spend my time writing half broken code in javascript, sometimes python. I can remember having a knack for computers and 
technology in general since I was young (younger?). I have mostly been making stuff with React and currently getting my head around making custom hooks. NodeJS is also something I am working with although starting with backend programming made me realize how little I know, which makes this more fun :)

Be sure to come back next time, I may have something new to read for you.
